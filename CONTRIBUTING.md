Make sure you have Node.js version 12 or newer and a recent version of yarn classic (1.X) installed.

## Pull request process

1. Create a pull request with the updated schema files.
2. Invite a maintainer to the Sanity project you created so changes can be tested.
3. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off from a maintainer, or if you do not have permission to do that then a maintainer will do it for you.
